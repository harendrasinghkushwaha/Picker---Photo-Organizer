## Name
Picker - Photo Organizer

## Usage
This Android application Picker aims to help Android users clean up their photo library by swiping Up to delete unwanted photos. It’s sort of “Tinder for Photos”.

## Description
One of the most common complaints from Android Users today is that they’re running out of space on their phones, and either aren’t quite sure what to do about it, or don’t have time to spend backing up then deleting all the photos that are weighing down their device.
The app is now one of many utilities arriving to address a longtime challenge smartphone users face – that is, our devices make it simple to take unlimited photos, but they don’t offer the same ease of use when it comes to reclaiming free space from our phone’s limited storage.
I also  struggled with having too many photos and no good way to organize them, the idea with Picker is to let you quickly move through your many images and make instant decisions on what to do with each one, using gestures.
On Android, you’ll swipe up on the photo to delete it, which helps to free up space.
